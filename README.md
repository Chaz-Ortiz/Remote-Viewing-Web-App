This application challenges users to **“see beyond the veil”** by intuitively guessing a hidden number between 1 and 99.  
After each guess, both the hidden number and the chosen number are revealed — along with how close the user’s perception came to the unseen truth.

## Concept

> “This is not a game — it’s a test of your intuition.”

The project playfully reinterprets a simple number guessing game as an **extrasensory perception (ESP)** or **remote viewing** experiment.  
It merges web technology with the aesthetics of mysticism, evoking Ouija boards, candlelit rituals, and astral exploration.
